# Introduction-to-Theoretical-Computer-Science
In this repository I'm sharing codes that were part of Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science subject at my collage (Zagreb Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing).

Software implementation of finite automata, finite automata minimization algorithms, pushdow automata, and recursive descent parsing. Students individually implement given assignment in a recommended programming language or tool, and submit their solutions to automatic online evaluation.
